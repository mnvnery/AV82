title: Miller Sprinter II 1 Stage Aluminum with Ground Spreader - 100MM
description: >-
  The Sprinter II 2-Stage Alloy Tripod offers speed without the compromise.
  Featuring Sprint-Locks-Dual and side-action leg locks, you will be able to
  independently adjust both stages of a 2-stage tripod using one hand. Each
  tripod leg has two Sprint-Locks, both located on the upper leg clamp,
  resulting in high-speed adjustment with no more bending to adjust the lower
  tripod stage.\

  \

  The Sprinter II Ground Spreader attaches directly to the spiked feet at the bottom of the tripod. Optimized for use on flat surfaces, the telescoping spreader arms allow for rapid set-up and pull down by keeping the tripod legs at an equal or preset distance.
